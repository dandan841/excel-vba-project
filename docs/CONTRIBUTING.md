# Contributing Guide

## How to Contribute VBA Code

1. **Export your VBA modules**: In Excel VBA Editor (Alt+F11), right-click each module/class and export to `/src`
2. **Test your code**: Ensure all macros work correctly before committing
3. **Document changes**: Update README.md with new features or changes
4. **Commit with clear messages**: Use descriptive commit messages

## Code Standards

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow consistent indentation
- Include error handling where appropriate

## Version Control Best Practices

- Commit frequently with small, logical changes
- Don't commit the actual Excel workbook with embedded VBA (export instead)
- Use branches for major features
- Write clear commit messages describing what changed
